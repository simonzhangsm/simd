BIGMATH::SIMD is a portable header-only zero-overhead C++ low level SIMD library.
The library presents a single interface over SIMD instruction sets present in
x86, ARM, PowerPC and MIPS architectures. On architectures that support
different SIMD instruction sets the library allows the same source code files
to be compiled for each SIMD instruction set and then hooked into an internal
or third-party dynamic dispatch mechanism. This allows the capabilities of the
processor to be queried on runtime and the most efficient implementation to be
selected.

The library sits somewhere in the middle between programming directly in SIMD
intrinsics and even higher-level SIMD libraries. As much control as possible
is given to the developer, so that it's possible to exactly predict what code
the compiler will generate.

Documentation

Online documentation is provided
[here](http://simonzhangsm.github.io/simd/v1.18.10.000/w/).

Compiler and instruction set support
------------------------------------

The library supports the following architectures and instruction sets:

 - x86, x86-64: SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, SSE4a, AVX, AVX2, FMA3, FMA4, AVX512F,
 AVX512BW, AVX512DQ, AVX512VL, XOP, popcnt
 - ARM 32-bit: NEON, NEONv2
 - ARM 64-bit: NEON, NEONv2
 - PowerPC 32-bit big-endian: Altivec, VSX v2.06, VSX v2.07
 - PowerPC 64-bit little-endian: Altivec, VSX v2.06, VSX v2.07
 - MIPS 32-bit little-endian: MSA
 - MIPS 64-bit little-endian: MSA

Supported compilers:

 - C++11 version:
   - GCC: 4.8-7.x
   - Clang: 3.3-4.0
   - Xcode 7.0-9.x
   - MSVC: 2013, 2015, 2017
   - ICC (on both Linux and Windows): 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017

Various compiler versions are not supported on various instruction sets due to
compiler bugs or incompletely implemented instruction sets. See
simd/detail/workarounds.h for more details.

 - MSVC and ICC are only supported on x86 and x86-64.

 - AVX is not supported on Clang 3.6 or GCC 4.4

 - AVX2 is not supported on Clang 3.6.

 - AVX512F is not supported on:
    - GCC 5.x and older
    - Clang 5.0 and older
    - MSVC

 - NEON armv7 is not supported on Clang 3.3 and older.

 - NEON aarch64 is not supported on GCC 4.8 and older

 - Altivec on little-endian PPC is not suppported on GCC 5.x and older.

 - VSX on big-endian PPC is not supported on GCC 5.x and older.

 - MSA is not supported on GCC 6.x and older.
