Indicates support of 64-bit floating-point elements in the SIMD unit. The library provides API for 64-bit floats even if this macro is defined to {{c|0}} and uses scalar implementation in that case.

Currently, the macro is defined to {{c|1}} on the following instruction sets:

* {{c|SIMD_USE_SSE2}}
* {{c|SIMD_USE_NEON && SIMD_64_BITS}}
* {{c|SIMD_USE_VSX_206}}
* {{c|SIMD_USE_MSA}}
